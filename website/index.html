   <p id="para1">The image you see is the one I belive represents me. This is Hermione Granger, an infamous character from the series of Harry Potter. I have a lot in common with her, starting from being a huge bookworm,to being family and friend oriented. I am 23 years olds and I am currently aiming to hone my coding skills. </p>

   <p class="para2">I'm currently a chef that works for different occasions. I never liked doing the same thing over and over again. I like making or creating new dishes from different cultures. It is quite fun, wether you are working by yourself or with a great team.</p>

   <p class="para2">My first career choice was actually, Computer Science Engineering. And that I am having the chance to get into the tech world, I am more then excited to finally initiate in the career of my choice.</p>
